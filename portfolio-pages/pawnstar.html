              <h2>Project details</h2>
              <p>In the fascinating world of artificial intelligence and chess, we've embarked on an exhilarating journey to train a chess-playing AI that rivals grandmasters. The project combines the power of reinforcement learning with sophisticated training strategies to create an AI chess player that continuously improves its skill set.</p>
              <p>Training Approach, the AI's learning process is a well-orchestrated symphony of techniques:</p>
              <p>üß† Behavior Cloning: The AI starts by learning from the masters, copying the moves of a teacher agent that plays against itself. This serves as the foundation for understanding basic chess strategies and principles.</p>
              <p>üèÜ Training Against the Teacher Agent: The AI then faces off against a formidable teacher agent, a strong algorithmic AI. This adversary employs cutting-edge tree evaluation algorithms like NegaScout, combined with the power of StockFish NNUE for position evaluation. This challenging match-up pushes our AI to learn from the best, improving its game one move at a time.</p>
              <p>üÜö Self-Training: The learning process doesn't end here. Our AI continues to evolve by playing against itself. </p>
              <p>üîÅ This is then repeated with an increased difficulty from the teacher agent to push our agent to learn even better strategies each time</p>
              <p>Technology Stack:</p>
              <p>üêç Python & RLlib: The heart of our project is Python, where we leverage RLlib, a powerful reinforcement learning library, to train our AI. This allows us to fine-tune our AI's decision-making capabilities and learn from its mistakes.</p>
              <p>‚öôÔ∏è C++ for Performance: To ensure maximum speed and efficiency, we've implemented the teacher agent and the chess environment in C++. This minimizes bottlenecks, enabling our reinforcement learning AI to train as rapidly as possible.</p>
              <p>The result is a chess-playing AI that showcases the best of both worlds: the analytical prowess of algorithmic AI and the adaptive learning of reinforcement learning.In the fascinating world of artificial intelligence and chess, we've embarked on an exhilarating journey to train a chess-playing AI that rivals grandmasters.
